lilliputian is a dead simple URL shortener that redirects all URLs in its directory.

Installation:
1. Create a database
2. Run the SQL in lilliuptian.sql to create the table
3. Copy config.php.default to config.php
4. Fill in the values in config.php

That's it!

NOTE: the only current functionality is redirecting to URLs that are manually entered into the database. Creation from the web and viewing stats will be coming soon.
